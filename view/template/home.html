                We are a warm group of Christians who are striving to worship God in the same way that the first century
                Christians did.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this way we are striving to continue the divine unity that Jesus prayed for (John 17v 21). The church
                of Christ has congregations throughout the United Kingdom and all over the world. However we have no
                central organization on earth, but we have a common cause: to be the Church as it was when first
                instituted
                by the Lord Jesus Christ.

                More over the Bible teaches us that our practices and teachings must be by the authority of our Lord
                Jesus
                Christ. Whatever you do, whether in word or in deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
                thanks
                to God the Father through him (Colossians 3v17)..

                sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful..
